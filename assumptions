I was working in a warehouse for a nonprofit called OneSource. 
Shortly before that I was working for a local news broadcast called WLWT. 
I heard about Max through a coworker of mine at OneSource. 
Her friend did the program and has had great success with it. 
I wasn't sure what to think at first and was hesistant to join it at first. 
I know a little bit about code just by practicing it on the side but I wasn't sure
if I could make a career out of it. I have always had an interest in coding 
but was too afraid to try it until now.
